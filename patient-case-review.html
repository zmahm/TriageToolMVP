        <p><strong>Triage Level:</strong> Further review required by NHS 111</p>
        <p><strong>Suggested Action:</strong> An NHS 111 operator should contact the patient as soon as possible for further assessment.</p>
        <p><strong>AI Confidence Level:</strong> 91%</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
          Rationale: The patient reported multiple symptoms that may indicate early signs of a more serious respiratory or cardiovascular issue. Human oversight is recommended to validate the AI recommendation before any referrals or escalation.
